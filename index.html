<p>The temperature of our world is increasing, sea levels are rising and glaciers are melting. This is the evidence 
of climate change we are now experiencing. Everyone must take part in climate action because this will affect the future's 
situation. This website is based on SDG 13 and shows actions that today's generation are encouraged to do on the specific 
measures that an adult, student, and child can do for a sustainable environment and climate.</p>

<p>Regardless of your age or background, everyone can be a part of climate action. Reducing energy usage, sustainable transportation,
 water conservation and waste reduction alongside eating less meat can make a massive change. Furthermore, advocating for climate-impactful
 policies is a vital way to fight the crisis this planet is in right now. The global public can protect the planet and tackle climate change
 if they stand together.
